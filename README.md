# McKinsey Digital Lab Application

This is the application from Linan Qiu (lq2137@columbia.edu) for the **Developer** and **Data Scientist** positions at MDL.

## Developer

### Braces

The brace program is coded in nodeJS. To run,

```
$ node braces.js
```

Test cases are hardcoded.

### Spotify

For the spotify app, I used 3 APIs

- Metadata API (depreciated by Spotify)
- Web API (currently encouraged by Spotify) using a 3rd party nodeJS wrapper
- Web API, using requests totally homebrewn.

A working version of the app can be found at [https://enigmatic-lowlands-2198.herokuapp.com](https://enigmatic-lowlands-2198.herokuapp.com)

## Data Scientist

The explanation is in the site itself. Its rather long.

Just select the unzipped .csv file provided. You should see magic at
